# SAS---create-a-text-file
Created a output file in the text format for users to pick easily

This code will allow user to create a text file at your desired location based on your input table. 
The connection being used here is Teradata SQL Studio express
If you have a table where all your data exists but you need to somehow send those data to your collaborators or partners so they can get through a text file through a linux terminal or an email rather than sending the entire details of the table, this code will be beneficial for the purpose of creating results in the text file.
